# Environmental Data Ethics and Accessibility Resources (EnDEAR)
## What is this about?
This resource was produced as part of the 2024 [NCEAS Environmental Data Science Summit](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/environmental-data-science-summit). It is intended to help researchers/anyone who produces environmental data generate a series of questions to inform their decision-making about data sharing and communication. Data sharing presents a huge variety of accessibility, privacy, technical, and ethics challenges, and this is far from an exhaustive list. The questions are arranged into three sections depending on when they would ideally be addressed-- Pre-Research, During Research, and Pre-Publication. At the bottom there is also a list of more general resources.

## How can I help?
This document is designed to be ever-evolving. Feel free to create a PR to add to this document if you know of any additional resources. This document relies on people with a variety of backgrounds contributing their knowledge. If you have any questions about how to do this, feel free to email nastassiabot@gmail.com.

## Questions

### Stage 1: Pre-research

#### Accountability
* What intention are you going into research with?
* What community/stakeholders are affected by this research/data sharing?
* What social governance systems are already in place in this community?

#### Assessing Risk
* Is there any personal information in this data?
  * If so, what level of anonymization or de-identification is needed
    * Is that possible with the type of data in consideration?
  * If not, are there any broader harms to society that could result from the widespread use of this research?
* What kind of risk mitigation measures are already in place?
* What tools/risk assessments can be used to assess risk opportunity impact?

**Resources**: [Microsoft Data Ethics](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/blob/main/1-Introduction/02-ethics/README.md)-- info about privacy, informed consent, right to be forgotten, and other concerns

#### Funding
* Does the funding of the research require data to be open?
* Are there any costs to making data available? 
* Are there any costs to making access conditional?

#### Power and politics
* What is the political landscape of the area of research?
* Does this data span legislative boundaries?
  * If so, which ones? How does this affect the research and/or data sharing?
* Who can do something about the problem related to this data?
* Is there a power imbalance between stakeholders?

#### Sharing Motives
* Who owns this data “legally”? / “ethically”?
  * How do you plan to determine this?
* Do stakeholders want this data to be shared?
* Why do people want this data to be shared?

#### Indigenous Data 
* Does indigenous land sovereignty play a role in sharing this data?

**Resources**: [Indigenous Peoples' Specialty Group Ethics Statement (AAG)](https://sites.evergreen.edu/zoltan/wp-content/uploads/sites/358/2023/09/IPSGResearchEthicsFinal.pdf)

#### Data Storage and Management
* How long should the data be kept?
* Where data will be housed/how will it be made available? 
* Will that change over time? Is it funding dependent?

**Resources**: [USFS Research Data Archive](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/submittingData)-- managed repository for any data collected with USFS funding or on USFS land

### Stage 2: During Research
