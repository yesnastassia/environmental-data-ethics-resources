# Environmental Data Ethics and Accessibility Resources (EnDEAR)
## What is this about?
This resource was produced as part of the 2024 NCEAS Environmental Data Science Summit. It is intended to help researchers/anyone who produces environmental data generate a series of questions to inform their decision-making about data sharing and communication. Data sharing presents a huge variety of accessibility, privacy, technical, and ethics challenges, and this is far from an exhaustive list. The questions are arranged into three sections depending on when they would ideally be addressed-- Pre-Research, During Research, and Pre-Publication. At the bottom there is also a list of more general resources.

## How can I help?
